# RISC CPU

Project realised in the context of the Numerical Systems Architecture course @CentraleSup√©lec.

## Steps of the project

- Design the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Implementation of the different components in VHDL using Intel Quartus Prime
- Development of an assembly program using our ISA to test CPU functionalities
- Simulation of the implemented circuits using ModelSim
